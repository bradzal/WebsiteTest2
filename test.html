							<h1>Retrofit over Replacement Thanks to Provantage</h1>
							<p>ProVantage was commissioned by a high tier packaging company to assess, evaluate, and improve their current packaging machinery and bring it up to today’s standards.</summary><br> The existing machinery’s legacy controls and hardware were found to be causing a bottleneck in the facilities operating capabilities. Despite the machines good condition it appeared the only solution would be too replace it with a newer, more recent model.<br><br>
ProVantage was able to remedy this situation by assessing the limitations of the machine, highlighting the areas of retrofit possible, as well as where controls upgrades could be applied while retaining pre-existing components to reduce cost of the project. Effective analysis by ProVantage allowed for appropriate legacy controls to be applied, making use of existing legacy controls and I/O and upgrading it to standard industry controllers without compromising the operability. This was further continued by the upgrading of both the panel and VFD’s to further improve the machines operational capability.<br><br>
As a result of this, what was the original plan to be a complete replacement, became a more efficient retrofit upgrade utilizing current components available at a fraction of the cost of the originally proposed machine replacement.<br><br>

							<h1>ProV Virtual Reality is a Real Hit with Ontario’s Packagers</h1>
							<p>ProVantage Automation was a featured exhibitor at the recent Top 50 Packaging Technologies, with Brad, Jesse and Rob demonstrating ProV’s suite of automation solutions to Ontario’s packaging elite.</summary>  A real hit for the guests was the Virtual Reality Lab that ProV uses for the development and validation of some of its advanced machines.<br><br>  
The VR Lab allows ProV designers and engineers to look inside at all mechanical assemblies for conflicts in full scale.  It also allows end users to see the machine ‘walk through’ to fully understand the design advantages of the new PHC VantageCaser, due to roll out soon.<br><br> 
The VR Lab is a useful tool that is an adjunct to ProV’s engineering designs and further reduces the development time of new mechanical designs.  As a validation tool, the VR Lab can help users ensure the quality of design by walking through and beside everything from complex building layouts to process piping installations to anticipating ergonomic anomalies.  Want to see inside a control cabinet ... easy;  like to see the machine in a different color?  Done;   wish to validate the utility runs through a building?  You can walk right beside them.  Check to make sure the energy conduits are separated properly, before they are built?  Do it at your desk.<br><br>
The VR Lab is just another innovative tool that ProV uses to make  End Users more productive and respond to increasing market demands.  You are invited to drop into the Ancaster Automation Center to experience this novel tool for solving complex issues. </p>
